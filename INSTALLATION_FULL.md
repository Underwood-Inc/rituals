## What You're Installing

2. **Resource Pack** - Custom visuals (stone walls with runes, custom item textures)

## Requirements

- Minecraft Java Edition 1.21 or newer

## Step 4: Optional - Add Custom Textures

The resource pack includes placeholder textures. To add your own custom stone wall designs:

1. Navigate to: `resourcepacks/Totem_Rituals/assets/rituals/textures/item/`
2. Read the `TEXTURES_README.txt` file
3. Create PNG files (16x16 or higher) with the specified names:
   - `totem_wood.png` - Stone wall with brown runes
   - `totem_iron.png` - Stone wall with silver runes
   - `totem_diamond.png` - Stone wall with cyan glowing runes
   - `paste.png` - Wheat paste texture
   - `upgrade_slate_iron.png` - Stone tablet with iron runes
   - `upgrade_slate_diamond.png` - Stone tablet with diamond runes

4. Press `F3 + T` in Minecraft to reload resource packs

---

## Troubleshooting

**Datapack not loading:**
- Type `/reload` in-game
- Check `/datapack list` - should show `rituals`
- If disabled, type: `/datapack enable "file/rituals"`

**Resource pack not working:**
- Make sure it's in the Selected packs list
- Press `F3 + T` to reload
- Check the `pack.mcmeta` file exists

**Items have default textures:**
- This is normal if you haven't added custom PNG files
- The datapack will still work perfectly!
- Add textures later to get custom visuals
