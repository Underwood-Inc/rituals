## How Quotes Work

When a soul weapon displays a quote (on its tooltip), the system selects based on two factors:

1. **Era** — determined by the weapon's current level (6 eras total)
2. **Mood** — randomly selected from the 3 moods available in the current era

Each mood contains exactly **20 quotes**, and one is randomly chosen per display. Additionally, there are **30 ascension-specific quotes** that trigger during ritual events.

| Era | Name | Level Range | Moods |
|-----|------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Awakening | 1-15 | Eager, Curious, Fierce |
| 2 | Growth | 16-30 | Bonding, Confident, Reflective |
| 3 | Maturity | 31-50 | Wise, Loyal, Powerful |
| 4 | Mastery | 51-70 | Legendary, Commanding, Ominous |
| 5 | Transcendence | 71-90 | Divine, Ancient, Terrifying |
| 6 | Apotheosis | 91-100 | Godlike, Transcendent, Philosophical |
