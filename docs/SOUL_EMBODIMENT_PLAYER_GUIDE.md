# 🌟 What If Your Weapons Could GROW With You?

Imagine this...

You've been using your **Diamond Sword** for weeks. You've slain hundreds of zombies, defeated the Ender Dragon, and explored countless dungeons. But your sword? It's still just... a sword. Same stats. Same boring tooltip. 

**What if it could REMEMBER all those battles?**

**What if it could get STRONGER the more you use it?**

**What if it could develop its OWN PERSONALITY?**

## ✨ INTRODUCING: THE SOUL EMBODIMENT RITUAL ✨

This isn't just an upgrade. This is **TRANSFORMATION**.

With the Soul Embodiment Ritual, your ordinary tools become:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 😐 Just a diamond sword | ⚔️ **"GRIMFANG"** - A living weapon that HUNGERS for battle! |
| 😐 Just a pickaxe | ⛏️ **"STONEHEART"** - A mining companion that REMEMBERS every diamond! |
| 😐 Just a bow | 🏹 **"SKYPIERCE"** - An archer's best friend that YEARNS to fly! |

# 🎮 HOW IT WORKS (It's Actually Easy!)

## Step 1: Gather Your Materials 📦

You'll need these items:

| Item | Where to Get It | What It Does |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| 🏛️ **5 Totems** | Craft them! | The ritual anchors |
| 🪨 **Soul Sand** | The Nether | Captures the soul |
| 🟣 **Ender Pearl** | Kill Endermen | Binds dimensions |
| ✨ **Glowstone Dust** | The Nether | Life energy |
| 💎 **Amethyst Shard** | Amethyst Geodes | Crystal resonance |
| ⚔️ **Your Weapon!** | Your inventory | THE STAR OF THE SHOW |

## Step 2: Build The Pattern 🏗️

Place your totems like this:

```
                    🏛️ NORTH
                  (Soul Sand)
                      ⬆️
                      |
                   5 blocks
                      |
     🏛️ WEST ◀️——————⚔️——————▶️ 🏛️ EAST
   (Amethyst)     YOUR TOOL!    (Ender Pearl)
                      |
                   5 blocks
                      |
                      ⬇️
                    🏛️ SOUTH
               (Glowstone Dust)
```

**Pro Tip**: Count 5 blocks from center in each direction. Use F3 if you need coordinates!

## Step 3: AWAKEN YOUR WEAPON! 🔥

1. Put your weapon on the **CENTER** totem
2. Put the soul components on the **FOUR** outer totems
3. Light a **FIRE** at the base of the center totem
4. **WATCH THE MAGIC HAPPEN!** ✨🔥✨

Your weapon now has a **SOUL**!

# ⚠️ FOOLISH AWAKENINGS (A Word of Wisdom)

> *"The ritual does not judge. It does not question. It will bind a soul to whatever you place upon the altar — a mighty blade, a humble hoe... or a potato. The soul does not care. But YOU should."*
>
> — Tome of the Ancients, Chapter III (Frequently Ignored)

The Soul Embodiment Ritual accepts **ANY item**. There is no restriction. You can soul-embody dirt, a bucket, a piece of string, a raw porkchop — anything your heart desires and your wisdom should prevent.

**What happens when you do this?**

| What You Get | What You Don't Get |
|---|---|
| A soul name (like "Ghosttouch" or "Phantomgrip") | Any practical way to earn XP |
| A personality and quotes | Any reason this was a good idea |
| Wasted catalysts and soul components | Your dignity |
| An item with existential dread | A refund |

**Why is this a bad idea?** Your soul absorbs experience passively just by **existing in your hotbar**. So technically, a soul-bound potato WILL level up at the exact same rate as a soul-bound diamond sword — the soul grows through observation, not deeds. The potato will gain a personality, talk to you, and accumulate buffs... on a potato. It's not impractical, it's just deeply, spiritually pointless.

> 💡 **Stick to tools and weapons.** Swords, pickaxes, axes, shovels, hoes, bows, crossbows, and tridents are the intended recipients. Everything else is technically functional but spiritually inadvisable.

# 📈 THE LEVELING SYSTEM (This Is Where It Gets EPIC!)

## Your Weapon Levels Up From 1 to 100! 

But here's the twist...

### 🎯 You Don't Unlock All 100 Levels At Once!

|-------|--------------|
| **1st Ritual (Awakening)** | Unlocks Levels 1-15 |

| **4th Ritual (Ascension III)** | Unlocks Levels 26-30 |
| **5th Ritual (Ascension IV)** | Unlocks Levels 31-35 |

| **17th Ritual (Ascension XVI)** | Unlocks Levels 91-95 |
| **18th Ritual (Transcendence)** | Unlocks Levels 96-100 (MAXIMUM POWER!) |

### Why Is This AWESOME?

Because **EVERY TIME** you do the ritual again, there's a **50% CHANCE** you get a **RANDOM ENCHANTMENT** from the entire vanilla pool! 🎲

That's right — any of the 40 vanilla enchantments, regardless of item type:
- ⚔️ Sharpness on a pickaxe? Sure.
- 🐟 Luck of the Sea on a sword? Why not.
- 🪶 Feather Falling on a trident? The soul doesn't judge.

**It's a cosmic gamble. You earn it, you keep it!**

# ⚔️ EARNING XP (Your Soul Grows Through Existence!)

Your soul weapon doesn't need to do anything special to grow — it absorbs experience simply by **being with you**. As long as at least one soul-embodied item is somewhere in your **hotbar** (slots 1-9), the soul passively accumulates XP over time.

> *"A soul does not require deeds to grow. It needs only to exist — to observe, to witness, to be present in the world. Through the simple act of existing alongside its wielder, the soul absorbs the fabric of experience itself."*
>
> — Tome of the Ancients, Chapter IX

### How It Works

1. Have **any** soul-embodied item in your **hotbar** (any of the 9 slots)
2. The soul's timer ticks every game tick while you play
3. When the timer reaches the configured interval, you receive **1 XP** (base rate)
4. The energy accumulates in YOU as pending soul energy
5. Channel it into a weapon via a **Totem** or **Scrying Glass**

**Multiple soul items in your hotbar?** Only ONE timer runs — no double-dipping!

### Offhand Catalysts (XP Multipliers!)

Holding certain items in your **offhand** while the soul timer ticks multiplies your XP gain:

| Offhand Item | Multiplier | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| *(empty)* | 1.0x | Normal rate |
| **Soul Sand** | 1.5x | The Nether's memory |
| **Soul Soil** | 1.5x | Ancient earth |
| **Amethyst Shard** | 1.75x | Crystal resonance |
| **Ender Pearl** | 2.0x | Dimensional energy |
| **Eye of Ender** | 2.5x | Focused perception |
| **Bottle o' Enchanting** | 3.0x | Concentrated experience |
| **Nether Star** | 5.0x | The ultimate catalyst! |

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: A Nether Star in your offhand cuts the time to max level by **80%**! It's the ultimate investment for serious soul growers.

### XP Rate Presets

Server admins and singleplayer users can choose how fast souls grow. The **default** is **Hard (3 minutes per XP)**.

| Preset | Interval | Time to Level 15 | Time to Level 50 | Time to Level 100 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Trivial** | 10s | ~11h | ~55h | ~160h (6.7 days) |
| **Easy** | 30s | ~34h | ~164h | ~481h (20 days) |
| **Moderate** | 1m | ~67h | ~329h | ~961h (40 days) |
| **Standard** | 2m | ~135h | ~657h | ~1,923h (80 days) |
| **Hard** *(default)* | 3m | ~202h | ~986h | ~2,884h (120 days) |
| **Tough** | 5m | ~337h | ~1,644h | ~4,807h (200 days) |
| **Grueling** | 8m | ~539h | ~2,630h | ~7,691h (321 days) |
| **Brutal** | 10m | ~674h | ~3,287h | ~9,614h (401 days) |
| **Punishing** | 15m | ~1,010h | ~4,931h | ~14,421h (601 days) |
| **Extreme** | 20m | ~1,347h | ~6,574h | ~19,228h (801 days) |
| **Insane** | 30m | ~2,021h | ~9,862h | ~28,842h (3.3 years) |
| **Nightmare** | 45m | ~3,031h | ~14,792h | ~43,262h (4.9 years) |
| **Impossible** | 60m | ~4,041h | ~19,723h | ~57,683h (6.6 years) |

> All times are **active play hours** (item in hotbar, Minecraft running). With a Nether Star offhand (5x), divide all times by 5.
>
> At 4 hours/day of play on **Hard** with no catalyst: Level 15 takes ~50 days, Level 100 takes ~2 years.
> With a Nether Star on **Hard**: Level 15 takes ~10 days, Level 100 takes ~5 months.

### XP Milestones

| 🎯 Level | 📊 Total XP | 🏃 % Complete |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| 15 (1st cap) | 4,041 | 7.0% |
| 25 | 8,384 | 14.5% |
| 50 (halfway) | 19,723 | 34.2% |
| 75 | 38,807 | 67.3% |
| 100 (MAX!) | 57,683 | **100%** |

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Early levels are FAST — the first 15 levels only need 7% of total XP! But levels 75-100 need a third of ALL the XP. That's what makes Level 100 so LEGENDARY!

### Changing the XP Rate

**With the mod installed:**
```
/rituals config xp_interval easy        → 30 seconds per XP
/rituals config xp_interval hard        → 3 minutes per XP (default)
/rituals config xp_interval 100         → custom 5 seconds per XP
```

**Datapack-only (no mod):**
```
/function rituals:config/soul_xp/set_easy
/function rituals:config/soul_xp/set_hard
/function rituals:config/soul_xp/set_impossible
```

For custom intervals (datapack-only):
```
/data modify storage rituals:config soul_xp_interval set value 100
/function rituals:config/soul_xp/set_interval
```

> All XP rate commands require **OP permissions** (level 2+).

# 🌟 THE SOUL BOND

## How XP Actually Works (The Lore!)

When you awaken a weapon, something magical happens... **YOUR soul becomes linked to the weapon's soul.**

### ✨ The Soul Bond

> *"A Soul-Bonded weapon does not grow through violence or labor. It grows through existence itself — through witnessing the world alongside its wielder. Every sunrise, every storm, every quiet moment in a mineshaft. The soul absorbs the fabric of experience simply by being present."*
>
> — Tome of the Ancients, Chapter VII

When a soul weapon sits in your **hotbar**, the soul passively absorbs experience from the world around it. The energy doesn't go directly into the weapon — it accumulates within YOU as pending soul energy, growing slowly and steadily over time. Holding certain items in your **offhand** acts as a catalyst, amplifying the absorption rate.

### 🔮 How Soul Energy Flows

╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### 📊 What This Means For You

| Concept | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Soul Energy (Pending)** | Experience your soul passively absorbs while a soul weapon is in your hotbar. Stored within YOU. |
| **Weapon XP** | Permanent power stored IN the weapon itself. Gained only through channeling via a conduit. |
| **Channeling** | The totem (or Scrying Glass) acts as a conduit, transferring your stored soul energy into the weapon to strengthen its bond. |
| **Offhand Catalyst** | Holding specific items in your offhand multiplies passive XP gain (e.g., Nether Star = 5x). |

### 🎯 The Strategic Advantage

This system gives you **CHOICE**! 

> *"The soul grows with its wielder, not through any specific action. A warrior who fights all day and a builder who constructs all day absorb soul energy at the same rate — for it is the soul's presence in the world that matters, not the wielder's deeds. Choose wisely where to channel that energy."*

**Example Scenario:**
1. You play for 2 hours with **Soul Pickaxe "Stoneheart"** in your hotbar → Your soul absorbs energy passively
2. You swap Stoneheart for **Soul Sword "Grimfang"** and play 1 more hour → Your soul absorbs MORE energy
3. Your total stored soul energy = all the XP accumulated from 3 hours of play
4. You place Grimfang on a totem → The totem channels ALL stored energy into Grimfang!
5. Stoneheart got none... but you can channel to it next time!

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- 🔄 **Absorbed energy is shared** — It doesn't matter WHICH soul weapon was in your hotbar when the XP was earned
- 🎁 **You choose where it goes** — Place a weapon on a totem to channel ALL stored energy into it
- 🧹 **Channeling clears your reserves** — After channeling, your stored soul energy resets to 0
- 🏛️ **Multiple soul weapons?** — They share one timer; channel into your favorite!
- ⏱️ **Multiple soul items in hotbar?** — Only ONE timer runs, no bonus for stacking

### 💎 Pro Tips

| Tip | Strategy |
|-----|----------|
| 🎯 **Focus Leveling** | Channel all energy into one weapon to max it fast! |
| ⚖️ **Balanced Leveling** | Alternate which weapon you channel to each session |
| ⭐ **Nether Star** | Hold in offhand for 5x XP — the ultimate soul catalyst |
| 🕯️ **Soul Sand** | Easy to get, 1.5x multiplier — great early-game catalyst |

# 💬 YOUR WEAPON HAS A PERSONALITY!

This is the COOLEST part!

When your weapon awakens, it gets:

## 🏷️ A Unique Name!

Your weapon receives a randomly generated fantasy name like:

| Weapon Type | Example Names |
|-------------|---------------|
| ⚔️ Swords | Grimfang, Vexbane, Soulreaver, Bloodthirst |
| ⛏️ Pickaxes | Stoneheart, Orebiter, Earthshatter, Deepdelver |
| 🪓 Axes | Timberghast, Splinterfury, Barkrender |
| 🏹 Bows | Skypierce, Windseeker, Hawkstrike |

## 💭 Personality Quotes!

Your weapon TALKS to you through its tooltip! Quotes change based on the weapon's **level era** (which determines its maturity) and **mood** (randomly assigned per quote display). There are **6 eras**, each with **3 moods**, and **20 quotes per mood** — totaling **360 era quotes** plus **30 ascension-specific quotes** (390 total).

A quick taste of the progression:

### Early Game (Levels 1-15 — Awakening):
> *"I sense great potential in you, wielder."* (eager)
> 
> *"What mysteries await us beyond the horizon?"* (curious)
> 
> *"Point me at your enemies. I will not disappoint."* (fierce)

### Mid Game (Levels 31-50 — Maturity):
> *"Experience has taught me patience."* (wise)
> 
> *"I would shatter myself before betraying you."* (loyal)
> 
> *"Few remain who dare challenge us openly."* (powerful)

### End Game (Levels 71-90 — Transcendence):
> *"We have transcended mortality together."* (divine)
> 
> *"I feel older than the mountains themselves."* (ancient)
> 
> *"Even I am unsettled by what I have become."* (terrifying)

### MAX LEVEL (Levels 91-100 — Apotheosis):
> *"I AM BECOME DEATH, DESTROYER OF WORLDS."* (godlike)
> 
> *"I perceive all possible realities simultaneously."* (transcendent)
> 
> *"Having achieved everything, I wonder what remains."* (philosophical)

For the **complete list of all 390 quotes**, see **[SOUL_QUOTES_REFERENCE.md](SOUL_QUOTES_REFERENCE.md)**.

### What Can You Win?

**ANY of the 40 vanilla enchantments in the game.** The pool is type-agnostic — the item doesn't matter. You're rolling the cosmic dice.

| Category | Enchantments in Pool |
|----------|---------------------|

> **Wait... Sharpness on boots? Feather Falling on a sword?**
>
> Yes. This is a soul gamble, not a curated enchanting table. You earned these through 
> blood, sweat, and ritual fire. The universe doesn't care about "intended use."
> Some rolls will be incredible. Some will be... interesting. That's the price of power.

### Maximum Bonuses From 18 Rituals:

If you're **SUPER LUCKY** (50% each time), you could get up to **9 bonus enchantments**!

Each enchantment can be rolled multiple times — it stacks up to its vanilla max level. So your Level 100 sword could theoretically accumulate:
- Sharpness **V** (from bonuses!)
- Mending **I** (from bonuses!)
- ...or Feather Falling IV, because the gods have a sense of humor.
- **PLUS** whatever enchantments it already had!

🤯 **THE ULTIMATE GAMBLE!**

# 📖 AN EXAMPLE JOURNEY

Let's follow **"Grimfang"** - a soul-awakened diamond sword:

## 🌅 Day 1: The Awakening
You perform the Soul Embodiment Ritual on your diamond sword.
- **Name assigned**: "Grimfang"
- **Starting quote**: *"Together, we shall carve our legend."*
- **Level cap**: 15
- **XP rate**: Hard (3 minutes per 1 XP) — the default

## ⚔️ Weeks 1-7: The Slow Burn (with Nether Star)
You keep Grimfang in your hotbar and a Nether Star in your offhand (5x XP). At Hard+Star, that's 5 XP every 3 minutes — Level 15 needs 4,041 XP → ~40 hours of play. After ~10 days at 4h/day, Grimfang reaches Level 15!
- **Tooltip says**: *"I yearn to break these chains and reach new heights..."*
- **You perform the Ascension Ritual**
- 🎲 **BONUS ROLL**: SUCCESS! Sharpness +1!
- **New level cap**: 20

## 🌙 Months 2-5: Growing Stronger
You've been playing with Grimfang faithfully. Level 50 needs 19,723 XP → ~197 hours (with Nether Star). After ~50 days at 4h/day, Grimfang reaches Level 50!
- **8 rituals performed**
- **4 bonus enchantments received** (lucky!)
- **Current bonuses**: Sharpness 2, Looting 1, Mending 1, Feather Falling 1 (wait, what?)
- **Quote**: *"Few remain who dare challenge us."*

## 🔥 Months 5-15: TRANSCENDENCE
You've done it. 18 rituals. Level 100 needs 57,683 XP → ~577 hours (with Nether Star). After ~145 days at 4h/day, OMEGA status!
- **Final quote**: *"I am the end of all who oppose you."*
- **Total bonuses**: Sharpness 3, Looting 2, Mending 1, Feather Falling 1 (7 lucky rolls! Some... questionable.)
- **Your sword literally GLOWS with power!**

**Grimfang is now LEGENDARY!** 🏆

> Without a catalyst on the **default Hard** preset, these times are 5x longer. The journey IS the reward — there are no shortcuts (except better catalysts and easier presets).

# ❓ FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

## "What happens if my weapon BREAKS?!"
😢 **Bad news**: If your soul weapon's durability hits zero... the soul is LOST FOREVER.

💡 **Pro tip**: Use **Mending** and **Unbreaking** enchantments to protect your investment! Your soul weapon is PRECIOUS!

## "Can I use this on ANY tool?"
✅ **YES!** Works on:
- Swords, Pickaxes, Axes, Shovels, Hoes
- Bows, Crossbows, Tridents
- Even modded tools (if configured)!

## "Can I rename my soul weapon?"
✅ **YES!** Use the command `/rituals soul rename <new name>`

You get ONE free rename per level. Choose wisely!

## "Do bonuses stack with existing enchantments?"
✅ **YES!** If your sword already has Sharpness III and you roll a Sharpness bonus, it becomes Sharpness IV! Each enchantment stacks up to its vanilla maximum level. And yes, "illegal" enchantments that don't normally go on your item type are kept too — you earned them through ritual fire.

## "What's the point of doing 18 rituals?"
🎯 Each ritual:
- Lets your weapon level HIGHER
- Gives 50% chance for FREE enchantments
- Makes your weapon's personality EVOLVE
- Is an investment in YOUR unique legendary item!

## "Is Level 100 worth the grind?"

# 🔮 THE SCRYING GLASS (Portable Sync!)

Don't want to trek back to your totem every time? **CRAFT A SCRYING GLASS!**

> *"The Scrying Glass is a portable conduit, forged from crystal and amethyst. Through its lens, the bond between wielder and weapon becomes visible — a shimmering thread connecting your soul to the blade. When you gaze through this mystical device, the glass acts as a bridge, channeling your stored soul energy directly into the weapon, strengthening its bond without need of a totem."*

> — Enchanter's Codex

### 📍 Visual Reference

```
   HOTBAR:
   [ ][ ][ ][🔮][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]    ← Scrying Glass selected (mainhand)
   
   OFFHAND SLOT:
   [⚔️]                            ← Soul Weapon here!
```

## ⚠️ Limited Uses!

The glass has **5 uses** before it shatters! The mystical energies required to peer between realms slowly degrade the crystalline structure.

| Uses Left | Glass Status |
|-----------|--------------|
| 5 | ✨ Pristine |
| 4 | ✨ Good |
| 3 | ⚡ Fading |
| 2 | ⚡ Cracking |
| 1 | 💔 Final use! |
| 0 | 💥 **SHATTERED!** |

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Save your Scrying Glass for when you're far from home with lots of pending Soul Energy. For quick syncs near your base, just use the totem!

# ⚡ RANDOM BUFFS & DEBUFFS!

Every time your soul weapon **LEVELS UP**, you gain a **RANDOM BUFF!**

## 🟢 Possible Buffs (You Get ONE Each Level!)

There are **20 buffs** in the pool. Each level up, one is randomly selected. If you already have it, it stacks (up to its max level). Equal 1/20 chance for each.

| # | Buff | What It Does | Max Level |
|---|------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | ⛏️ **Soul Haste** | +10% mining speed per level | III |
| 2 | ✨ **Soul Sight** | Nearby entities glow within 10 blocks | I |
| 3 | 🧲 **Magnetic Pull** | Attract items: 5 blocks (I), 7 blocks (II) | II |
| 4 | 🖐️ **Extended Reach** | +0.5 block interaction range per level | III |
| 5 | 🔧 **Soul Mending** | 0.5% chance per tick to repair 1 durability | III |
| 6 | 🍀 **Fortune's Favor** | +0.5 luck per level | II |
| 7 | 💨 **Soul Speed** | +3% movement speed per level | III |
| 8 | 💪 **Soul Strength** | +0.5 attack damage per level | IV |
| 9 | 🛡️ **Soul Armor** | +1 armor per level | III |
| 10 | 🦘 **Featherweight** | Jump Boost I | I |
| 11 | 🔥 **Soul Flame** | 10% chance per level to ignite targets on hit | II |
| 12 | ❤️ **Soul Leech** | 5% of damage dealt is healed per level | II |
| 13 | 📖 **Soul Wisdom** | +10% soul XP gain per level | II |
| 14 | 💎 **Soul Harvest** | Extra drops (like Looting) per level | II |
| 15 | 🛡️ **Eternal Edge** | 25% less durability loss per level | II |
| 16 | 👁️ **Dark Vision** | Night Vision effect while held | I |
| 17 | 🫧 **Aquatic Soul** | Water Breathing effect while held | I |
| 18 | 🔥 **Flame Ward** | Fire Resistance effect while held | I |
| 19 | 🍞 **Soul Sustenance** | 0.5% chance per tick for Saturation effect | II |
| 20 | 🤫 **Reserved Soul** | Weapon speaks less often (personality) | I |

## 🔴 Possible Debuffs (30% Chance Each Level)

On each level up there is a **30% chance** a debuff is also rolled. There are **11 debuffs** in the pool, each with equal chance (1/11).

| # | Debuff | The Downside | Max Level |
|---|--------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | 🍖 **Ravenous Soul** | Chance per tick for Hunger effect (1/400 at I, 1/200 at II) | II |
| 2 | ⚓ **Burdened** | -3% movement speed per level | II |
| 3 | ☠️ **Cursed Aura** | 1/6000 chance per tick for Bad Omen (600s) | I |
| 4 | 💔 **Brittle Edge** | +25% durability loss per level | II |
| 5 | 📢 **Restless Soul** | 1/400 chance per tick to alert nearby raiders | I |
| 6 | 😵 **Clumsy Grip** | Chance per tick for Mining Fatigue (1/600 at I, 1/300 at II) | II |
| 7 | 🎲 **Misfortune** | -0.5 luck per level | II |
| 8 | 🕳️ **Soul Hunger** | +20% soul XP required per level to level up | II |
| 9 | 👻 **Paranoid Soul** | 1/1200 chance per tick for random spooky sounds | I |
| 10 | 💀 **Bloodthirst** | Takes 1 damage every 30s if no combat (must feed the soul) | I |
| 11 | 🗣️ **Chatty Soul** | Weapon speaks MORE often (never shuts up) | I |

### ⚔️ BUFF/DEBUFF CONFLICTS!

Some buffs **BLOCK** opposing debuffs (and vice versa). If you already have one side, the conflicting roll is rerolled:

| If You Have... | You're Protected From... |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| 💨 Soul Speed | ⚓ Burdened |
| ⚓ Burdened | 💨 Soul Speed |
| 🍀 Fortune's Favor | 🎲 Misfortune |
| 🎲 Misfortune | 🍀 Fortune's Favor |
| 🔧 Soul Mending | 💔 Brittle Edge |
| 🛡️ Eternal Edge | 💔 Brittle Edge |
| 💔 Brittle Edge | 🔧 Soul Mending, 🛡️ Eternal Edge |
| 🍞 Soul Sustenance | 🍖 Ravenous Soul |
| 🍖 Ravenous Soul | 🍞 Soul Sustenance |
| 🤫 Reserved Soul | 🗣️ Chatty Soul |
| 🗣️ Chatty Soul | 🤫 Reserved Soul |
| 🔥 Flame Ward | 🫧 Aquatic Soul, 🔥 Soul Flame |

**Strategy:** Getting good buffs early protects you from their opposing debuffs later!

### 🔄 BUFFS & DEBUFFS CAN STACK!

Roll the same buff twice? **IT GETS STRONGER!** 💪

Your weapon could end up with balanced combos like:
- 🧲 Magnetic Pull II + 💨 Soul Speed III = **ITEM VACUUM SPEEDER**
- 💪 Soul Strength IV + 🔥 Soul Flame II = **BLAZING WARRIOR**
- 🍖 Ravenous II + 🗣️ Chatty = **ANNOYING HUNGRY WEAPON** (oops)

## ⚠️ THE FRACTURED SOUL (10% DANGER!)

**BEWARE!** Each level up has a **10% chance** to **FRACTURE** your soul weapon!

If this happens:
- ❌ Your weapon can **NEVER** ascend beyond its current tier
- ❌ You're **STUCK** at that level cap forever
- 💔 The soul is **PERMANENTLY BROKEN**

*High risk, high reward! Every level is a gamble!*

---

# 🔧 VANILLA ENCHANTMENTS? TOTALLY FINE!

**YES, you can still enchant your soul weapons!** 

Soul weapons are **100% compatible** with vanilla enchantments:

| Action | Works? |
|--------|--------|
| ⚒️ Enchanting Table | ✅ YES |
| 📖 Anvil + Books | ✅ YES |
| 🔨 Anvil Repairs | ✅ YES |
| 🪓 Grindstone | ✅ YES (keeps soul!) |

**Your soul weapon can have BOTH:**
- Regular vanilla enchantments (applied via enchanting table, anvil, or ascension bonus rolls)
- Soul buffs (the 20 random buffs gained on each level up — see the Buffs & Debuffs section above)

**MAXIMUM POWER COMBO POSSIBLE!** ⚡⚔️⚡
