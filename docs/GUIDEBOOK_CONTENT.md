3. **Prioritize critical info** - Fire sacrifice and pattern rituals are must-haves
4. **Reference external docs** - For detailed guides, point to markdown files
5. **Test in-game** - Verify colors render correctly and text fits on pages
6. **Update this document** - Keep this reference file in sync with the actual book

### Character Limits Per Page:
- **Safe limit**: 200-220 characters
- **Maximum**: ~250 characters (may cause issues)
- **Formatting counts**: `\n` counts as 2 characters

### JSON Formatting:
```json
'{"text":"Your text here\\n\\nNew paragraph","color":"dark_purple","bold":true}'
