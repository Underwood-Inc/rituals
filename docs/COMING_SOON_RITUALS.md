# Coming Soon: Advanced Multi-Totem Rituals

This document outlines the planned advanced ritual system that will be added in future updates. These rituals will require specific multi-totem patterns and specialized catalysts to create powerful custom enchantment and crafting effects.

---

## Overview

Advanced rituals represent the pinnacle of totem magic, requiring careful planning and significant resource investment. Unlike standard single-totem rituals, these require specific geometric patterns and act more like custom enchantments or crafting stations.

> **‚úÖ Already Implemented**: Auto-Farming (Diamond Hoe, 4+ totems, fire sacrifice)  
> See main README for usage instructions!

## Activation Requirements

All advanced rituals share these requirements:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Place Totems<br/>in Pattern] --> Verify{Pattern<br/>Valid?}
    Verify -->|No| Fail[Ritual Fails]
    Verify -->|Yes| Catalyst[Place Catalyst]
    Catalyst --> Fire[Ignite with Fire]
    Fire --> Consume[Catalyst Consumed]
    Consume --> Active[Ritual Active]
    
    style Start fill:#2196F3,stroke:#0D47A1
    style Catalyst fill:#FF9800,stroke:#E65100
    style Active fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#1B5E20
    style Fail fill:#F44336,stroke:#B71C1C
```

1. **Correct Pattern**: Totems must be placed in exact geometric pattern
2. **Minimum Tier**: Most require Diamond or Netherite totems
3. **Catalyst Placement**: Central catalyst must be specific item
4. **Fire Sacrifice**: Use flint & steel near catalyst to activate
5. **Catalyst Consumption**: Catalyst is consumed permanently

---

## Pattern Validation

When placing the final totem in a pattern:
- ‚úÖ Green particles indicate valid pattern
- ‚ùå Red particles indicate invalid pattern
- üí° Yellow particles show where next totem should go

Power a totem with redstone to visualize the full pattern with particle effects.

## Future Updates

Additional rituals planned for future releases:
- **Spawner Control Ritual** - Modify mob spawner behavior
- **Nether Portal Network** - Link multiple portals with specific destinations  
- **Resurrection Altar** - Return to death point with items
- **Crop Mutation Station** - Crossbreed plants for new varieties
- **Beast Taming Circle** - Tame normally untameable creatures

---

## Technical Notes

- All advanced rituals persist through server restarts
- Rituals are chunk-loaded (within spawn chunks or manually loaded)
- Multiple rituals can overlap with careful planning
- Some rituals are mutually exclusive in the same area
- Ritual data stored in world NBT (no performance impact)
