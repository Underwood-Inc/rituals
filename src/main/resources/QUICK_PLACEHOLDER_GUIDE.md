# Quick Placeholder Textures

If you want SOMETHING to show instead of default items but don't want to create detailed pixel art:

## Super Simple Method (5 Minutes)

### Tools Needed:
- MS Paint (Windows)
- Preview (Mac)  
- GIMP (any OS, free)

### Steps:

1. **Create a 16x16 canvas**
   - New Image â†’ 16Ã—16 pixels

2. **Fill with base color:**
   - Wooden Totem: Brown (#8B4513)
   - Iron Totem: Gray (#808080)
   - Diamond Totem: Cyan (#00FFFF)
   - Paste: Yellow (#FFD700)
   - Iron Slate: Gray (#C0C0C0)
   - Diamond Slate: Cyan (#00FFFF)

3. **Add simple details:**
   - Use pencil tool (1 pixel brush)
   - Draw a few dark lines for "runes"
   - Add 2-3 lighter pixels for highlights

4. **Save as PNG:**
   - File â†’ Save As â†’ PNG
   - Use exact names (totem_wood.png, etc.)
   - Save to: `resourcepack/assets/rituals/textures/item/`

5. **Test in game:**
   - Press `F3 + T` to reload
   - Check items in inventory

### Even Simpler: Solid Colors

Just create 16x16 PNG files filled with solid colors:
- They'll work and look distinct from each other
- Better than default Minecraft items
- Can upgrade to detailed textures later

### Color Reference:
```
totem_wood.png       â†’ Brown/Tan
totem_iron.png       â†’ Gray/Silver  
totem_diamond.png    â†’ Cyan/Light Blue
paste.png            â†’ Yellow/Tan
upgrade_slate_iron.png    â†’ Dark Gray
upgrade_slate_diamond.png â†’ Bright Cyan
```

That's it! You're done! ðŸŽ‰
