=== TOTEM RITUALS - TEXTURE GUIDE ===

This folder needs PNG texture files (16x16 pixels recommended, can be higher resolution).
Below are descriptions of what each texture should look like:

===================================

TO USE THESE TEXTURES:
1. Create PNG files with the exact names listed above
2. Place them in this folder (resourcepack/assets/rituals/textures/item/)
3. Ensure they're 16x16 pixels (or higher multiples like 32x32, 64x64)
4. Use transparent backgrounds where appropriate

If you don't create custom textures, the resource pack will fall back to default Minecraft textures.
