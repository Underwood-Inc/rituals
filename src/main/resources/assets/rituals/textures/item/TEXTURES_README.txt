===================================

TO USE THESE TEXTURES:
1. Create PNG files with the exact names listed above
2. Place them in this folder (resourcepack/assets/rituals/textures/item/)
3. Ensure they're 16x16 pixels (or higher multiples like 32x32, 64x64)
4. Use transparent backgrounds where appropriate

If you don't create custom textures, the resource pack will fall back to default Minecraft textures.
