# ========================================
# Preview System Example
# ========================================
# This shows how to implement enchanted preview text
# for "2 steps ahead" advancement previews

# Example: Show what comes after the current advancement
# The key is using obfuscated text with hover effects

# Method 1: Static Preview Advancements
# Create advancement files with obfuscated titles and descriptions
# Use "impossible" criteria so they never complete
# Update them dynamically based on player progress

# Method 2: Dynamic Text Updates
# Use /title or /tellraw to show preview information
# Update advancement descriptions via data modification

# Method 3: Hover Tooltips
# Add hover events to existing advancements
# Show "Next: [Enchanted Text]" in descriptions

# Example implementation:
tellraw @s [{"text":"ðŸ”® ","color":"dark_purple"},{"text":"Preview System Active!","color":"gold","bold":true}]
tellraw @s [{"text":"Next: ","color":"gray"},{"text":"Â§kÂ§lÂ§6Mystical Totem CraftingÂ§r","obfuscated":true,"bold":true,"color":"gold","hover_event":{"action":"show_text","value":{"text":"Craft a Diamond Totem Base to unlock the next tier!","color":"yellow"}}}]
