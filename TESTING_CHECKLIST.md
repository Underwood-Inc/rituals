## How Item Display Works

### For ANY Item:
1. Place totem (Sneak + Right-click)
2. Hold ANY item (emerald, diamond, dirt, sword, etc.)
3. Right-click the totem
4. Item appears floating on top!

### For Ritual Items (Special):
When 3+ totems have the SAME item displayed:
- **Emerald** â†’ Growth Ritual (crops grow faster)
- **Diamond** â†’ Strength Ritual (combat buffs)
- **Gold Ingot** â†’ Prosperity Ritual (item magnet)
- **Iron Ingot** â†’ Protection Ritual (damages mobs)
- **Nether Star** â†’ Healing Ritual (heals players/animals)

Other items can be displayed but won't trigger rituals!
