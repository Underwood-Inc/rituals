               |

## Troubleshooting

### Ritual Won't Activate?

- [ ] 4 catalysts dropped? (correct type for tier)
- [ ] Fire lit at totem base?
- [ ] Ritual item on totem?
- [ ] Totem not already running ritual?
- [ ] Items on GROUND (not in inventory)?

### Items Disappeared?

- Fire burned them before detection
- **Solution**: Drop items FIRST, then light fire immediately
